            <h2 class="heading">UX Designer</h2>

            <div class="text">
                <p>I became interested in the field of UX design because of my background in psychology
                    and
                    research. I received
                    my
                    degree in Psychology and Social Behavior from UC Irvine. I am passionate about applying UX
                    principles
                    based
                    in
                    research as well as using user research findings to inform the design of web, and mobile
                    applications.
